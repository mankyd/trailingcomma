h2 About
    p
        | This site is to help web developers overcome a massive headache when
        | developing javascript. If you're not a webdeveloper, you can probably
        | stop reading now. In Internet Explorer 6 and 7, there is an easy to
        | introduce javascript bug relating to commas. If, when defining an
        | array or an object, you leave a trailing comma after the last item in
        | your collection, IE will fail to parse your javascript file:
    pre
        | var x = [1,2,3,]; //ERROR
        | var y = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3,}; //ERROR
    p
        | Unfortunately, this mistake is very easy to make but very hard to
        | track down in large javascript projects.

        | return back a simple JSON array containing data detailing any trailing
